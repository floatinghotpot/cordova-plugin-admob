# cordova-plugin-admob #

AdMob Cordova Plugin, provides a way to request AdMob ads natively from JavaScript. 

This plugin is mainly maintained by Raymond Xie, and also thanks to following contributors:

* @jumin-zhu, added interstitial support for Android.
* @fersingb, added interstitial support for iOS.
* @ihshim523, added initial WP8 support.
* @AlexB71, improved WP8 support.
* And, bugfix patches from @chrisschaub, @jmelvin, @mbektchiev, @grahamkennery, @bastaware, @EddyVerbruggen, @codebykevin, @codebykevin, @zahhak.

## Important Notice ##

As the re-designed **[AdMob PluginPro](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-admob-pro)** is proved much better and more than welcome by Cordova APP/game developers. This plugin will NOT be evolved any more, please use the pro version instead.

And, as announced by Cordova team, the plugins registry is being migrated to npm, you can find [all plugins by Raymond here](https://www.npmjs.com/~floatinghotpot).
